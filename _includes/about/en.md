I am currently seeking new career challenges as a [Certified Salesforce.com Platform Developer](/img/certifications.png), equipped with 8 years of practical experience in the Salesforce ecosystem. My proficiency spans the development lifecycle, application design, integration patterns, and deployment strategies, ensuring a well-rounded expertise.

My skills in Apex and Lightning development allow me to ensure high code quality and meet business needs through detailed code reviews, enhancements, and authorship. I excel at creating reusable UI/UX components with the Lightning component framework and fine-tuning code to adhere to Salesforce's governor limits.

With a quick aptitude for adopting new technologies and methodologies, I have effectively incorporated them into projects and workflows. I am eager to join a forward-thinking and innovative team, where I can further develop my skills and contribute positively.

If you're looking for a highly motivated professional with strong communication and problem-solving abilities, I invite you to [get in touch](mailto:hi@dyncan.com). I'm excited about the possibility of discussing how I can bring value to your organization and explore potential collaboration opportunities.
