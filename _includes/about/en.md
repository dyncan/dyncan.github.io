As a [Certified Salesforce.com Platform Developer](/img/certifications.png) with 8 years of hands-on experience, I am seeking new career opportunities. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle, including application design, integration patterns, and deployment strategies.

My proficiency in Apex and Lightning development enables me to ensure high code quality and meet business requirements through thorough code reviews, enhancements, and original development. I excel at creating reusable UI/UX components using the Lightning component framework and fine-tuning code to adhere to Salesforce's governor limits.

With a knack for quickly adopting new technologies and methodologies, I effectively incorporate them into projects and workflows. I'm eager to join a forward-thinking, innovative team where I can further develop my skills and make meaningful contributions.

If you're looking for a highly motivated professional with strong communication and problem-solving abilities, I invite you to [get in touch](mailto:dynckm@gmail.com). I'm excited to discuss how I can add value to your organization and explore potential collaboration opportunities.
