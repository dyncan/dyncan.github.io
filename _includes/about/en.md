I am actively pursuing new career opportunities as a [Certified Salesforce.com Platform Developer](/img/certifications.png), bringing 8 years of hands-on experience in the Salesforce domain. Proficient in the development lifecycle, application design patterns, integration patterns, and deployment planning, I ensure a comprehensive skill set.

My expertise in Apex and Lightning page builds enables me to guarantee high code coverage and fulfill business requirements through meticulous code review, adjustment, and writing. I have a track record of creating reusable UI/UX components using the Lightning component framework and optimizing code to align with Salesforce governor limits.

Demonstrating a rapid grasp of new technologies and processes, I successfully integrate them into projects and operations. I am enthusiastic about joining a dynamic and innovative team, aiming to advance my skills while making a positive impact.
